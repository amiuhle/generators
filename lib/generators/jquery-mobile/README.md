# jQuery Mobile generator

## Usage

    yeoman init jquery-mobile

This will ask if you would like to include Backbone support, and generate a scaffold so you're ready to rock with [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com)!

Currently all CSS/JS is included from CDNs, later versions of this generator will probably fetch the newest version of each.
